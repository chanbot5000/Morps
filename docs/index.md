MORPS - Modifying Objects to Reduce Python Scripting
========

Python should be simple. Writing ~50 lines of code to create one buffer is not simple. 

Morps attempts to simplify geoprocessing with Python. Using the terminal/command line interface, navigate to the directory storing the morps.py file. 

Type 
    
    python 

to start the python shell and begin using morps

    import morps

    cities = "data/cities.shp"
	cities_buffered = "data/cities_buffered.shp"
	buffer_distance = 500
	format = 'shp'

	morps.buffer(cities,cities_buffered,500,buffer_distance,format)

or even simpler

	morps.buffer("data/cities.shp","data/cities_buffered.shp",500,"shp")

Installation
========
>Note: This library is built on top of GDAL, and is required to be installed in order for MORPS to work correctly. [Find GDAL install instructions here.](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/gdal/) If you do not get errors when typing <b>import ogr</b> into the Python shell, you know that Python is configured and you are ready to use morps.

To install Morps, clone this repository or download the latest build from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Morps/0.1.4). Unzip the file and open the terminal (or Windows Command Shell) and cd into the directory. Type the following command to install:

    pip install .

If it installs with no errors, start the Python shell and attempt to import morps

    import morps

All right, lets Merk some Morps!

>Note: If you do not have pip installed (lookin' at you, Windows) you can install it by following [these instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip). If you get errors when typing pip into the command shell (after running get-pip.py) you may need to add pip to your %PATH% variable. 


>Windows users: To add pip to the %PATH% variable, open Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > Under "System Variables" scroll down to 'Path', click it and then click edit. Add the following text to the end of the Variable Value: ;C:\Path\To\Python\Scripts  where \Path\To\Python is the directory path to your local install of Python. It may look something like C:\Python27 or if you are an ArcGIS user it could look like C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.x\ and then you need to reference the Scripts folder inside the Python install directory, because that is where pip is stored. Also, it is imperative that a semi-colon is used to separate variables.

Geoprocessing Supported by Morps
========

* Buffer
* Contains
* Difference
* Disjoint
* Distance
* Equals
* Find Centroid
* Feature Count
* Get Feature Envelope
* Get Fields
* Get Layer Extent
* Get Unique Values
* Intersect
* Simplify
* Symmetric Difference
* Within

The code in this repo is also intended to demonstrate how one could utilize the OGR vector library within GDAL 
for performing basic geoprocessing tasks.
